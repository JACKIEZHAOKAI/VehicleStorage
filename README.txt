This program provides a menu for implementing GET, CREATE,
UPDATE, DELETE, FILTER, and PRINTALL methods, so the user 
can choose to manipulate the vehicle storage stored in a
linked list structure.

It is ok for the user to put either lowercase or uppercase for 
the options. Also, it is fine for the user to insert in 
uppercase or lowercase for the make and model, including the 
empty space. Because all the user's input for make and model 
wiil be coverted into concatenation of string in lowercase.
For example:  "hon D A" ------> "honda"
	      "C IV IC"-------> "civic"

The input ID has to be unquie, any duplicated ID will be prohibited.
The year must be between 1950 and 2050.
 
If the input is invalid, the user has to reenter valid 
information of the vehicle on the menu again.
